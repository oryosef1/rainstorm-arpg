## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE CRITICAL PATH** 

### **PHASE 9 TASK 1: Game Engine Integration** ⚠️ **START IMMEDIATELY**

**Implementation Requirements:**
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Main game loop connecting all systems
class GameEngine {
  private world: World;
  private renderer: GameRenderer;
  private inputManager: InputManager;
  private running: boolean = false;

  start(): void {
    this.running = true;
    this.gameLoop();
  }

  private gameLoop(): void {
    const deltaTime = this.calculateDeltaTime();
    
    // Update all ECS systems in real-time
    this.world.update(deltaTime);
    
    // Render game state to canvas
    this.renderer.render(this.world);
    
    // Update UI elements with real data
    this.updateGameUI();
    
    if (this.running) {
      requestAnimationFrame(() => this.gameLoop());
    }
  }
}
```

**Files to Create:**
- `game-core/engine/game-engine.ts` - Main game loop and coordination
- `game-core/engine/game-renderer.ts` - Canvas rendering system  
- `game-core/engine/input-manager.ts` - Input handling and player controls
- `game-core/engine/ui-bridge.ts` - Connection between game state and HTML interface

**Estimated Time**: 20-30 hours
**Blocking**: All other gameplay features

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY**

### **1. Game Engine Bridge Pattern**
```typescript
// Connect TypeScript backend to HTML5 frontend
interface GameStateToUIBridge {
  updateHealthBar(current: number, max: number): void;
  updateManaBar(current: number, max: number): void;
  updateInventorySlot(slotId: string, item: Item | null): void;
  updateCharacterStats(stats: CharacterStats): void;
  updateExperienceBar(current: number, required: number, level: number): void;
}
```

### **2. Real-Time System Integration**
```typescript
// ECS systems running in browser
class GameWorld {
  constructor() {
    this.systems = [
      new MovementSystem(),
      new CombatSystem(), 
      new InventorySystem(),
      new ProgressionSystem(),
      new RenderSystem()
    ];
  }
  
  update(deltaTime: number): void {
    this.systems.forEach(system => system.update(deltaTime));
  }
}
```

### **3. Player Interaction Layer**
```typescript
// Convert browser events to game actions
class PlayerController {
  handleMovement(keys: KeyboardState): void {
    // WASD movement with collision detection
  }
  
  handleSkillActivation(skillSlot: number): void {
    // Activate skills from action bar
  }
  
  handleInventoryInteraction(action: InventoryAction): void {
    // Drag/drop, equip/unequip, use items
  }
}
```
